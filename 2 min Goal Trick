The best and easiest way to do a 2 min Goal is to start one pass from center to left forward.
Then don't pass but do a through ball twce and finally o center forward.
Through through pass, you will easily get ahead of defenders and get an easy goal.
This trick works most of the time until the opponent is tougher than you and the difficulty level is higher than profeesional, i.e. World Class and Legendary.
